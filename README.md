```

## Issue

Generate an invoice for a named client with just one billable service. Use this when just one item description is required:
```bash
$ invoicerender issue --client=<client name> \
                      --item-description="Services provided last month" \
                      --item-unit-price=100 \
                      --item-currency=EUR \
                      --item-quantity=21 \
                      --item-vat-percentage=19
```

Generate an invoice for a named client with multiple billabe items:
```bash
$ invoicerender issue --client=<client name> --interactive --item-count=2

item1 Description: Services provided last month
item1 Unit Price: 100
item1 Currency: EUR
item1 Quantity: 21
item1 VAT Percentage: 19
